## Benefits of using `LineReader`:
- You can use it on iOS, macOS, Ubuntu
- Memory usage is extrimely low even for files with enormous size
- Fast (used low level API)

## Example

Suppose we have file with such content
```
stop_id,stop_code,stop_name,stop_desc,stop_lat,stop_lon,zone_id,stop_url,location_type,parent_station
5100083,,Kunowice,,52.3430780,14.6425210,,,0,
5189954,,Swinoujscie Centrum,,53.9129970,14.2360010,,,0,
5193610,,Slubice,,52.3415210,14.6183230,,,0,
8003774,,Lübeck St Jürgen,,53.8423750,10.7008680,,,0,
8010046,,Beucha,,51.3236210,12.5731330,,,0,
8010051,,Blankenberg(Meckl),,53.7723090,11.7152900,,,0,
8010059,,Borsdorf(Sachs),,51.3457250,12.5409000,,,0,
8010066,,Bützow,,53.8368140,11.9977410,,,0,

```

Read it line by line with `\n` delimiter, utf8 endcoding and chunkSize of 1024

```swift

guard let reader = LineReader(path: "/Path/to/file.txt") else {
    return; // cannot open file
}

for line in reader {
    print(">" + line.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines))      
}
 
```

Output

```
>stop_id,stop_code,stop_name,stop_desc,stop_lat,stop_lon,zone_id,stop_url,location_type,parent_station
>5100083,,Kunowice,,52.3430780,14.6425210,,,0,

>8010066,,Bützow,,53.8368140,11.9977410,,,0,

```

### Tip

If you see high memory usage with large files, use `autoreleasepool` block

```swift

guard let reader = LineReader(path: "/Path/to/file.txt") else {
    return; // cannot open file
}

for line in reader {
    autoreleasepool {
        print(">" + line.trimmingCharacters(in: .whitespacesAndNewlines))
    }
}

```


## How to use

Add `LineReader.swift` file to your project.
